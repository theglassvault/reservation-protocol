# Trust Scoring Engine (TSE) — GlassVault Labs

**The Trust Scoring Engine (TSE)** is the core logic behind the Reservation Protocol. It redefines access as *presence-aware*, *time-sensitive*, and *contextual*, replacing static credentials with a dynamic trust score that decays or reinforces based on behavior, time, and verification.

> **"Every second they're pretending, they're being watched by time."**

## Current Modules

### `trust_score.py`

Implements the first functional layer of the TSE:

- Models a trust score between 0.0–1.0
- Applies **exponential decay over time** if presence or proof signals are absent
- Logs each trust decay event for future analysis
- Prepares the foundation for adding presence signals, ZKP verification, and behavior-driven reinforcement

## Core Concepts

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Decay Logic**   | Reduces trust using exponential decay when identity goes silent |
| **Presence Signal** | External verification of identity existence (e.g. motion, login, heartbeat) |
| **ZKP Layer**     | Zero-Knowledge Proofs are supported as a high-integrity optional signal |
| **Trust Events**  | Every erosion or reinforcement is logged as a time-bound event for audit and analytics |
| **Scoring Philosophy** | Trust is *never static*—it rises or falls based on lived presence |

## Flexible Authentication Compatibility

Reservation is authentication-method agnostic.

- Passwords? Works.
- MFA? Works.
- Biometrics? Works.
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs? Works—and elevates trust faster.

ZKPs are supported as an optional, privacy-first signal, but Reservation adapts to your organization’s current stack. Trust is not fixed at login—it’s earned, eroded, or reinforced over time.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete `update()` method to apply presence and ZKP signals
- [ ] Add `simulate.py` to model erosion and reinforcement in time
- [ ] Integrate ZKP verifier module (optional)
- [ ] Begin scaffolding API/CLI interface for calling TSE functions
